**Steps to be followed before starting the StartScreen**

### Camera Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to ensure proper camera setup for the application:

1. **Connect the Camera:**  

   Make sure the camera is securely connected to your device.  

   Ensure the camera is connected to the application using the default settings.  

   If an external camera is being used, ensure it is correctly connected to your device.

2. **Check Camera Functionality:**  

   Verify that the camera is working properly. Open the camera application on your device and check for any errors or malfunctions.  

   If the camera is not functioning correctly, please contact product support services for assistance.

3. **Ensure High Megapixel Condition:**  

   Confirm that the camera is set to capture images in high megapixel condition. This ensures optimal image quality for the application's purposes.

4. **Contact Support:**  

   If you encounter any issues with the camera setup or functionality, please reach out to Product's support team for assistance.

5. **Troubleshooting:**  

   If you need further assistance troubleshooting camera issues, refer to the troubleshooting guide provided by the product support team.

6. **Additional Notes:**  

   - Make sure the camera lens is clean and free from any obstructions to avoid blurry or distorted images.

   - Check the camera settings to ensure they are configured according to the application's requirements.

### Desktop and Laptop Instructions

1. **Overheating**

   - **Desktop:**  

     Ensure that all fans are operational. Dust and debris can accumulate over time, obstructing airflow. Regularly clean the fans and vents to prevent overheating.

   - **Laptop:**  

     Check that the laptop's fans are functioning correctly. Laptops are more prone to overheating due to their compact size. Elevate the laptop to allow air circulation and avoid using it on soft surfaces that can block airflow.

     Connect the laptop charger directly to a wall outlet rather than relying solely on battery power during resource-intensive tasks to prevent overheating caused by power strain.

2. **GPU and CPU Requirements**

   - **Desktop:**  

     Ensure that your GPU meets the minimum requirements of an Nvidia RTX Card. A dedicated GPU with sufficient VRAM of 4GB is recommended for optimal performance.

     Similarly, verify that your CPU meets or exceeds the minimum processor requirements to run the application smoothly. A multi-core processor with a clock speed of at least 2.5 GHz is typically sufficient.

   - **Laptop:**  

     Due to their integrated graphics, laptops may have limitations compared to desktops. Ensure that your laptop's GPU meets the desktop requirements mentioned above for the CeraFlaw application.

     Check the CPU specifications to ensure it meets or exceeds the minimum requirements. A modern multi-core CPU with a base clock speed of at least 2.0 GHz is recommended for reliable performance.

## This is a brief introduction to what you must do after starting the StartScreen.

After starting the StartScreen, users need to follow these steps:

1. **Select Tile Size and Input Batch ID:**  
   Users are required to select the appropriate tile size from the available options and input the Batch ID associated with the tiles they want to inspect. Once done, they can proceed to submit the information.

2. **Redirect to Detection Screen:**  
   Upon submission, the application will automatically redirect users to the Detection Screen.

   - **Live Camera Feed Popup:**  
     On the Detection Screen, users will encounter a live camera feed popup. This popup will display real-time footage captured by the connected camera, enabling users to inspect visual defects in ceramic tiles efficiently.

   - **Details of Defects:**  
     Alongside the live camera feed, users will also find detailed information regarding any defects detected by the CeraFlaw application. This information will be presented in an organized manner, allowing users to quickly identify and address any issues with the inspected tiles.
